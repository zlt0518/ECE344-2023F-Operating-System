    You may write any of your own testing code here.

    You can execute it using `build/test/wut`. However, without your own
    implementation, it shouldn't do much. We'll run this code with the solution
    so you can clarify anything you want, or write a tricky test case.

    Place at least one call to `check` with a value (probably a return from a
    library call) that you'd like to see the output of. For example, here's
    how to convert `tests/main-thread-is-0.c` into this format:

   //Write your own test case and fuck up your colleagues!!!!!!
   //Just kidding, don't be the asshole:)


    return 0;
}
